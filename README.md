So this is just a practice project for the roadmap.sh. Anyway for some fast intruction to run.
1. Input your API Key at the constructor of Weather Service in main
2. Run the main file
3. You can input the name of the location or the Zip Code (I believe zip code only work for US territory tho)

So while this is something I do as quick as possible, I will refer the doc for you to read and config it as you want: https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/timeline-weather-api

Dunno who going to read this since I will publish the solution on roadmap.sh anyway. If you read it, have a nice day
